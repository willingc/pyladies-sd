>I would like a PyLadies in San Diego website that folks could use as a learning tool.
We have access to a website template that we can dev ourselves through PyLadies. http://www.pyladies.com/locations/sd/
I will implement a twitter account and facebook page
We also have a github account- that PyLadies set up.

I spoke with a friend at BrightScope- and they have an all women developer team- that we might be able to have come out and give a talk.
